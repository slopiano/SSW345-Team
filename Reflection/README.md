Design

1. What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?
   I think the most helpful method when it came to the initial design was setting up
   a meeting with our group and brainstorming different designs we could come up with.
   It also helped that we split up the work into different forms, where one indiviual would work on
   specifically just the database where another person may work mainly with grabbing information online from APIs.
   This allowed us to become experts in a sepcific domain and allowed us the freedom to design a particular portion
   while communicating to the team what they could add and how they could assist in the project.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
   I think the most difficult portion was working with the API. We used coinmarketcaps API
   which ended up being a really good choice since they had a lot of data we could retrieve as
   well as very thorough and easy to use documentation on how to access certain information.
   One thing we would probably do differently is the timing and storage of the data. Since we need
   to keep track of a certain cryptos prices, we had difficulty making sure that we stored the correct
   data and how to access the cryptos prices at certain times. An example of this would be to always
   keep track of a cryptocurrencies price a month ago and always keeping it accurate.

3. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
   In the future, a better method would be an agile developement method where we have various planned
   iterations with daily reviews, and that way we can also geet continuous feedback from our teammates
   to improve the code in ways that we wouldn't have thought about on our own. Having multiple iterations
   also gives the team a set goal to hit every week, which will keep us on track to provide consisten deliverables.

Implementation

1. What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?
   What was most helpful was the use of discord in implementation, testing, and integration.
   Since we had the bot utilized on discord, we all used the same discord server for testing. In this
   way, we were able to see what each teammate was working on to track each persons progress as well as
   how to use the bot for the functions they implemented.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
   What was most difficult was utilizing pull requests. It was a little weird to look at just the code on the request.
   For us we found that it was a lot easier to work with it, though the requests did provide good examples of
   where to look for the changes a user made.

3. What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
   One thing we could have used was utilizing test cases. We could have created a couple of test cases to ensure that
   on each change, the code was still functioning, and then we could use it to track progress as well. For this project
   it might not have been as useful since it was on a smaller scale, but for future projects it would be very useful.

Process

1. What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?
   What was most helpful about implementing kanban was that it notified each team member about who changed something
   as well as when they changed it. Essentially it notified us as to when we should pull changes. The pull requests also
   helped us specifically with where the changes were made. This was we could test it ourselves and then easily identify which functions had
   been added, deleted, or updated.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
   We would probably utilize the issues and issue assignments more. For this project, it was a little vague as to what we were doing
   and how we were going to do it. If I had to do it again I think we would discuss in more detail the inner workings of implementation in
   order to give each team member a better understanding of what to do and how to do it.

3. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?
   We would utilize an agile developement cycle. With this method, we would more easily be able to track everyones progress
   as well as have clearly defined sprints which would keep everyone updated with clear goals as to what needs to get done and by what time.

Overall
Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---compare and contrast how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.

Methods:

Waterfall: This is a very structured and linear model. This gives the users clear steps to complete in the software developement process and is very easy to implement
with milestones and tasks. This model has a disadvantage where no working software is produced until late in the cycle and does not accomadate changing requirements.

Spiral model: This model works much better with changing requirements, as the project isn't set up in a linear fashion like the waterfall method. It also
produces working code throughout the process and works better with agile developement. Some issues with this model is that it can be complex and it is difficult to
effectively manage time.

Processes:

Daily scrum: This method is great for keeping teammates up to date about what is being completed, as well as esuring everyone is getting work done efficiently.
The only downside to this is that it is that it is relatively time consuming and requires all team members or most attend.

Planning leveles: This gives the project some structure with a product backlog and iteration backlog. This allows each person
to understand the sprint and is very useful.

Stories: Stories assist in certain functionalty that we want the project to have. It also has an estimation for the amount of time
we believe the task will take ad allows us to evenlydistribute work.

When incorporating these processes and methods, some work better than others and when putting certain methods together, we can provide a robust and effective
software development cycle. Although the waterfall might be very set and clear, the spiral model is a much better model, especially with the project
we were working on since the requirements kept on changing and adapting. Being able to work more in phases with steps of working code along the way enabled us to have a clearer
picture as we went along. Another important aspect was story planning along with scrum meetings. This allowed us to keep track of everyones progress as well as assign individuals
to areas where they had strengths. When doing this we created stories and could discuss the amount of work it would take to ensure everyone did the right amount of work.
